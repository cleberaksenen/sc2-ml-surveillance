# ðŸ§¬ Enhancing SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance with qPCR Protocols and Machine Learning

This project integrates data science, molecular biology, and machine learning to enhance SARS-CoV-2 lineage surveillance through an optimized qPCR protocol and advanced classification models. By combining genomic analysis with machine learning (SVM, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting), it enables highly accurate variant identification, focusing on the BE.9 lineage.

This methodology is scalable, cost-effective, and particularly useful in resource-limited settings, offering a practical alternative to whole-genome sequencing. Additionally, it is a versatile approach, adaptable to other pathogens with relevant molecular signatures.
